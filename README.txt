- WHAT is Zargari language?
+ Zargari language is an encoding based on language rules for secret communication between two or more people.

- WHERE and WHY?
+ In the past, some people in Iran used this type of language encryption so that others would not notice the conversation between them.

- WHAT'S going on?
+ Until today, this type of encoding has only been done on the basis of Persian language rules.
+ In this project, I try to create an advanced structure so that Latin languages can also be converted into the Zargari language.
+ You can join me to revive this language and spread it all over the world.


* The future is encrypted ;)
